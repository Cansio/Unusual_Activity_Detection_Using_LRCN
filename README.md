# Unusual Activity Detection Using CNN-LSTM

This project is a deep learning-based system for detecting unusual or suspicious human activities (like violence or vandalism) from video streams using a combination of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** layers. It features real-time inference support and live alerting mechanisms.

## üîÑ Overview

* **Goal:** Detect and classify human activity into `LiftVandalism`, `Violence`, and `NonViolence`.
* **Approach:** Frame-wise feature extraction using CNN followed by temporal modeling using LSTM (LRCN architecture).
* **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
* **Real-Time:** Live camera/video stream support via socket communication
* **Alerts:** Email (with attached frame) and optional SMS alerts on violence detection

## üîπ Model Pipeline

### 1. **Preprocessing**

* Frames extracted from videos (fixed 20-frame sequences)
* Normalized and resized to 64x64
* Dataset saved in `.npz` format

### 2. **Model Architecture (LRCN)**

* TimeDistributed Conv2D + BatchNorm + Pooling + Dropout
* Bidirectional LSTM layers
* Final softmax layer for 3-class prediction

### 3. **Training**

* Dataset split: 75% train / 25% validation
* Optimizer: Adam
* Loss: Categorical Crossentropy
* Callbacks: EarlyStopping
* Mixed Precision training for GPU performance boost

## üí™ Augmentations Used

Custom video augmentations for better generalization:

* Horizontal Flip
* Brightness Up/Down
* Speed Up/Down
* Gaussian Blur
* Rotation
* Shadow Injection

These were applied to increase the size and diversity of the dataset.

## üîπ Inference and Deployment

### ‚úàÔ∏è **Offline Testing**

* Load any test video file
* Extract frames and classify
* Show predictions + confusion matrix

### üöÄ **Real-Time Streaming (Live Socket Inference)**

* `Sender`: Streams live frames to receiver
* `Receiver`: Receives, buffers, classifies using trained model, and shows results

#### Alerts

* Email alerts with attached frame sent on "Violence" or "LiftVandalism"
* Optional SMS alert via Twilio (can be toggled)

## üìä Results

* **Test Accuracy:** \~99.5%
* **Real-time Inference FPS:** \~15-25 (depending on system)
* **Alerts Sent:** Email (with snapshot)
